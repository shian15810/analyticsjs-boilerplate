# analytics

This is a fork from [philipwalton/analyticsjs-boilerplate](https://github.com/philipwalton/analyticsjs-boilerplate), only **autotrack.js** is currently supported.

I have modified this a little bit to make it work with **Facebook Pixel** as well as setting custom **time zone**, which is required by some **autotrack** plugins.

I have also added a function that you can manually send pageview to **GA** and **Pixel** whenever the url route of your app changes, if you wish doing so manually.

You can also send custom *event* (**GA** / **Pixel**) and *error* (**GA** only) using the exposed APIs provided in this package.

The APIs exposed are **init**, **trackError**, **trackEvent** and **trackPageview**. Read below for more details.

## Installation

First two environment variables are required to make this work as expected:

1. `REACT_APP_GA` or `GA`: (**Google Analytics** tracking ID, **required**!)
2. `REACT_APP_FBQ` or `FBQ`: (**Facebook Pixel** tracking ID, **required**!)
3. `REACT_APP_TV` or `TV`: (**Google Analytics** tracking version, defaults to `'1'`.)
4. `REACT_APP_TZ` or `TZ`: ([Time Zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones), defaults to `'America/Los_Angeles'`.)

Install using **npm**:

```sh
npm install --save https://github.com/shian15810/analytics.git
```

Or install using **yarn**:

```sh
yarn add https://github.com/shian15810/analytics.git
```

Then add this to your **index.html**:

```html
<script>
  !function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s){if(f.fbq)return;n=f.fbq=function(){n.callMethod?
  n.callMethod.apply(n,arguments):n.queue.push(arguments)};if(!f._fbq)f._fbq=n;
  n.push=n;n.loaded=!0;n.version='2.0';n.queue=[];t=b.createElement(e);t.async=!0;
  t.src=v;s=b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0];s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}(window,
  document,'script','//connect.facebook.net/en_US/fbevents.js');
</script>
<script>
  (function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i['GoogleAnalyticsObject']=r;i[r]=i[r]||function(){
  (i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date();a=s.createElement(o),
  m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0];a.async=1;a.src=g;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
  })(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga');
</script>
<script async src="//unpkg.com/autotrack/autotrack.js"></script>
```

## Usage

You can use this package on any framework, but I will demonstrate the example below in **React**.

In your react app, import `init` and execute it before executing `ReactDOM.render`:

```js
import {init} from 'analytics';
import {render} from 'react-dom';
import Root from './Root';

init();
render((<Root/>), document.getElementById('root'));
```

You can also send `pageview` manually whenever the route of your app changes, such as with **React Router**:

```js
import {trackPageview} from 'analytics';
import {browserHistory as history} from 'react-router';

history.listen(({pathname}) => trackPageview(pathname));
```

The method above is generally not recommended as built-in `urlChangeTracker` has already been registered to watch any change on the route. **Pixel** can do this out of the box too, unless you disable it with `fbq.disablePushState = true`.

To send custom *event* and its details to **GA** and **Pixel**:

```js
import {trackEvent} from 'analytics';

const eventCategory = 'button';
const eventAction = 'click';
const eventLabel = 'star';
trackEvent({eventCategory, eventAction, eventLabel}); // Send to GA only.
trackEvent({eventCategory, eventAction, eventLabel}, true); // Send to GA and Pixel.
```

Where `eventCategory` and `eventAction` are required params, and `eventLabel` is a optional param for storing the value of the action.

**autotrack.js** has its built-in functionality to send *error* to **GA**, but *error* from `Promise` is not handled:

```js
import {trackError} from 'analytics';

fetch('/api.json').catch(trackError);
```

In this way, we can ensure all *error* messages generated by client and `Promise` are handled and sent to **GA**.

Alternatively, you can use another **ES6** `import` styles if that suits you:

```js
import analytics from 'analytics';

const init = analytics.init;
const trackError = analytics.trackError;
const trackEvent = analytics.trackEvent;
const trackPageview = analytics.trackPageview;
```

# analytics.js boilerplate

Best practices for implementing analytics.js on modern websites.

For an in-depth explanation of all the features used in this boilerplate (as well as how to report on them), see my article:

[**The Google Analytics Setup I Use on Every Site I Build**](https://philipwalton.com/articles/the-google-analytics-setup-i-use-on-every-site-i-build/) &#8594;

## Boilerplate versions

### [`analytics/base.js`](/src/analytics/base.js)

The base boilerplate extends the [default tracking snippet](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/#alternative_async_tracking_snippet) and includes the following features:

- Tracks uncaught errors.
- Tracks custom user, session, and hit-level dimensions.
- Sends an initial pageview.
- Sends a pageload performance event.

### [`analytics/autotrack.js`](/src/analytics/autotrack.js)

The autotrack boilerplate builds on top the base boilerplate and includes [select autotrack plugins](https://philipwalton.com/articles/the-google-analytics-setup-i-use-on-every-site-i-build/#using-autotrack-plugins)

### [`analytics/multiple-trackers.js`](/src/analytics/multiple-trackers.js)

The multiple-trackers boilerplate builds on the autotrack boilerplate and includes support for using [multiple trackers](https://philipwalton.com/articles/the-google-analytics-setup-i-use-on-every-site-i-build/#testing-your-implementation).

## Running the boilerplate locally

analytics.js boilerplate uses [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to compile the source and [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server) to run it locally.

To install the dependencies and load the boilerplate in a browser, run the following commands:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Then visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser and open the developer console to see the analytics.js debug output.

### Running different boilerplate versions

The boilerplate [`index.js`](/src/index.js#L7) JavaScript file imports the base boilerplate by default. To run a different version, replace the URL imported via `import('./analytics/base.js')` with the version you want to load.
